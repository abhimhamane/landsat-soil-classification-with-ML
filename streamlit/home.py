    This project is on understanding and developing intution for Machine Learning and Neural Networks. These 
    techniques/approaches cannot be and should not be treated as 'Black-Boxes'. Inthis project, I have tried to 
    show this fact visually by selecting a not much explored dataset of 'Soil Classification'. 
    
    First, we start with the dataset exploration and then develope some standard metrics such as spectral reflectance curve and
    pair-plots. I have tried different ML classifiers like KNN Classifier, Nearest Centroid, Random Forest, etc.
    The philosophy of these approaches can be visualized by their performance on the soil data.
